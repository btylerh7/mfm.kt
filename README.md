mfm.kt is a Kotlin library designed to parse text containing MFM format (Misskey Flavored Markdown) and convert it into a syntax tree for easier recognition in programming. This project can be described as a port of [mfm.js](https://github.com/misskey-dev/mfm.js) to Kotlin and is heavily influenced by it.

Note: The [mfm.js documentation](https://github.com/misskey-dev/mfm.js/blob/develop/docs/syntax.md) has a detailed description of the MFM format.

## Installation

mfm.kt is registered on GitHub Packages and can be used via Gradle (of course, you can also download the jar file directly from this project's releases). To use it via Gradle, add the following configuration to your build.gradle:

            username = project.findProperty("gpr.user") ?: System.getenv("USERNAME_GITHUB")
            password = project.findProperty("gpr.token") ?: System.getenv("TOKEN_GITHUB")
        }
    }
